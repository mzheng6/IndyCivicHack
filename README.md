<h1>Branch Structure</h1> -->
	<ul>
	<li><b>Master</b> -> Never push a commit to this individually. This branch is for the final presentable product only. The product in this branch should have all features (in that version) working with no bugs. Only develop should be merged into this, after careful testing. 
	<li><b>Develop</b> -> You can merge your personal branches into this. This should be the branch where you have the next release of the product, before it is actually released. This might have small bugs in the functionality, and should be merged into Master after testing. 
	<li><b>Personal Branches</b> -> These are the places where you will have new features being made. Feel free to make new branches for each new feature you work on, and sub-branch it as per your comfort. Merge this branch into develop after you are done with the feature functionality and some initial personal testing. 
	</ul>
